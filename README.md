# Arch Nemesis Detector
Sponge Bob has Squidward. Batman has the Joker. Every hero has an arch nemesis (and yes, Sponge Bob is a hero). 

Be a hero yourself; find out who your arch nemesis is with the Arch Nemesis Detector!

## How to Use
The Arch Nemesis Detector is a full-stack site that takes in survey results from the user, and then compares their answers with those from other users. The app then displays the name and picture of the user with the most differentiating results from the current user, thus displaying their arch nemesis. As the user, all you need to do is navigate to the survey, input your name and share a valid image link. Then, go through and answer the provided questions on a scale of 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). Hit submit to see the name and image of your Arch Nemesis.

## Feedback
This is my first FULL-STACK site-woot woot! #movingparts. Understanding the relationship between the different files and how to get and post information was where I spent most of my time on this site. A lot of people like the backend because according to them it cuts down on the noise of having to format etc., but I personally love the front-end and am glad to have had the opportunity to incorporate it into this back-end heavy project. This was also my first time using the Heroku server and I am impressed by how fluid the set-up and deployment were. Now stop reading this and go try the app! Thank you for checking it out!
