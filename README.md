find out who your arch nemesis is! ArchNemesisDetector will compare your survey results to that of others and will return the one from whom you most differ, aka your arch nemesis! While the assignment origionally wanted to find who the user had the most similar results to, this version has flipped that to find who the user has the most different results from.
